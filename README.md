This repo contains all the code files and report files for the completion of a data analytics projects around milk production in Ireland and the EU.

The data was sourced from data.gov and eurotstat which are freely available datasets.

The repo consists of fodlers containing the code files in jupyter notebook (.ipynb) format and the report files are written in microsoft word (.docx)

The project consists of a sentiment analysis perfomed on tweets about dairy production research in Ireland which was performed on Tweet data collected using the free Twitter API. 

An interactive dashboard was created showing a choropleth map of Europs milk production from 1970 to 2021 which allowed the user to chose the year of data to display.

Interactive figures were created using plotly express to show differences in European Milk productin in recent years compared to Ireland.

Different datasets were merged, cleaned and prepared for implemetation into machine learning models to precdict milk production.

Linear regrression, decision tree regressor and random forest regressor were compared for their ability to predict Milk productin with random forest regressor showing the highest accuracy.
