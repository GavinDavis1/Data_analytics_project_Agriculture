    "This notebook contains the code required to generate a Twitter API using a Twitter developer account to scrape tweets regarding dairy research and perform a sentiment analysis on the area. Recent tweets were gathered using the Twitter API and stored in a csv file named data.csv. The text data was cleaned and preprocessed for implementation into NLTK and a machine learning algorithm to predict positive, negative and neutral sentiment surrounding research in dairy."

    "After collecting tweet data using twitter api the tweets were processed using NLTK to remove stopwords and stem similar words, also removing symbols generating cleaned text data. Textblob was then used to assess the polarity of the tweets in other to generate metrics like polarity which could be used to understand sentiment. Based on a polarity greater than 0 tweets were deemed positive, while polarity less than 0 were deemed negative. Tweet data with a polarity equal to 0 were labelled neutral. After sentiment classification data was implemented into a machine learning model, Gaussian naive bayes classifier to generate a machine learning which could predict the sentiment of raw tweet data. This model showed approximately 50% accuracy."
